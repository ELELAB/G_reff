This repository includes scripts to back-calculate NOEs from biomolecular ensembles, such as the ones obtained by a MD simulation, as well as to compare to a set of experimental ones.
It contains two python scripts:
1.  NOEconverter.py which helps in the creation of the right file format for the experimental data
2. g_reff to carry out the calculation of NOEs from the ensemble, as well as to compare with the experimental NOEs. 

usage: g_reff [-h] -r NOES [-p PDB]

Calculate Reff on selected atom classes from an MD simulation

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r NOES, --reff NOES  noes file
  -p PDB, --pdb PDB     pdb file

EXAMPLE

An example is provided in this repository with a short trajectory to test the tool.
